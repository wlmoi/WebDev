# Document Object Model
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents.
It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. 
The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.

In HTML DOM (Document Object Model), every element is a node:

    A document is a document node.
    All HTML elements are element nodes.
    All HTML attributes are attribute nodes.
    Text inserted into HTML elements are text nodes.
    Comments are comment nodes.
